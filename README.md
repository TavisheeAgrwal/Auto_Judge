# Auto_Judge
This is a tool built for judging the difficulty levels and alloting scores for coding problems.
Online programming platforms categorize problems by difficulty level and assign difficulty scores, which are typically determined through human judgment and user feedback. This project proposes AutoJudge, an automated system that predicts the difficulty class (Easy, Medium, Hard) and a numerical difficulty score for programming problems using only their textual descriptions.
